# Grove

Planning and design docs for the Grove project.

## Main Instruction

- Always update `docs/implementation-plan.md` after work is done, before final handoff.
- Keep the update concrete: what changed, current status, and next steps.

## Project Structure

```text
docs/
  PRD.md
  implementation-plan.md
  adr/
```

## Workflow

```bash
# Review current plan
cat docs/implementation-plan.md

# Edit docs
$EDITOR docs/implementation-plan.md
```
